Master thesis at DLR, institute of Communications and Navigation.  
   1. Provide Synthetic seismic measurement data generation via wave PDE solver  
   2. Inversion algorithm design to estimate subsurface model parameters 
   3. Deconvoluton and Wiener Filter design to perform denosing
   4. Numerical optimization schemes with sensor fusion algorithm implementation via average consensus and adapt-then-combine to achieve autonomous subsurface exploration.
